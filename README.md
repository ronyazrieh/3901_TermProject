### Brief Overview
We are confident to say that we have gathered a general consensus of our plan for this project. Our idea is exploring Time and Culture as an art. Using artifacts from these specific moments in time to immerse the viewer through an art piece. Using the art piece to begin the experince, but the culture and time period is the actual art that is being explored.

### Challenge
We didn't have that great of a challenge this week, besides timing and making sure we could find an appropriate time when everyone was avaialble.

### Successes
Our greatest success was how well our discussion played out. Everyone was inputting ideas, and ebcause of that we were able to merge ideas to create something we are all interested in exploring.

#### Hours
1.5

### Video Reference

### Brief Overview
Our idea has been through multiple refinements and edits, although it seems we have finally agreed upon something we are all eager and interested in developing. We have decided to focos on the early Canadian artist Cornelius Krieghoff. We decided that it was a great way to incoorpate environment building, Canadian art, and an interesting experience. The goal is to have the user start in a studio, to which they must enter grayscaled paintings of Cornelius, expereince the environemnt, and solve the puzzle in order to get the full painting back in the studio. We have selected a couple paintings of his to branch off from.

### Challenge
We defenitely struggled this week in terms of brainstorming. Our idea kept getting close to attruition until we all decided to try something different. It was not until we decided to make our scope clear and focus on something we all were intereste in that we came up with this idea.

### Successes
Luckily everyone played into their roles quite well. All of our roles were discussed and it seemed we were all in agreement and have a great share of responsibility between the 5 of us.
