### Brief Overview
We are confident to say that we have gathered a general consensus of our plan for this project. Our idea is exploring Time and Culture as an art. Using artifacts from these specific moments in time to immerse the viewer through an art piece. Using the art piece to begin the experince, but the culture and time period is the actual art that is being explored.

### Challenge
We didn't have that great of a challenge this week, besides timing and making sure we could find an appropriate time when everyone was avaialble.

### Successes
Our greatest success was how well our discussion played out. Everyone was inputting ideas, and ebcause of that we were able to merge ideas to create something we are all interested in exploring.

#### Hours
1.5

### Video Reference
I provided this video in our discussion as a way to describe how we can explore this interactve art experience.
