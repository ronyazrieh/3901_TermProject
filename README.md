This initial week we started by officiating our group and began brainsotmring different topics we would be interested in exploring. As their has been no in class meeting we have yet to develop much further. Our plan is to finalize our brainsotmring and figure out a plan soon.

### Brief Overview
We are confident to say that we have gathered a general consensus of our plan for this project. Our idea is exploring Time and Culture as an art. Using artifacts from these specific moments in time to immerse the viewer through an art piece. Using the art piece to begin the experince, but the culture and time period is the actual art that is being explored.

### Challenge
We didn't have that great of a challenge this week, besides timing and making sure we could find an appropriate time when everyone was avaialble.

### Successes
Our greatest success was how well our discussion played out. Everyone was inputting ideas, and ebcause of that we were able to merge ideas to create something we are all interested in exploring.

### Video Reference
I provided this video in our discussion as a way to describe how we can explore this interactve art experience.

### Brief Overview
Our idea has been through multiple refinements and edits, although it seems we have finally agreed upon something we are all eager and interested in developing. We have decided to focos on the early Canadian artist Cornelius Krieghoff. We decided that it was a great way to incoorpate environment building, Canadian art, and an interesting experience. The goal is to have the user start in a studio, to which they must enter grayscaled paintings of Cornelius, expereince the environemnt, and solve the puzzle in order to get the full painting back in the studio. We have selected a couple paintings of his to branch off from.

### Challenge
We defenitely struggled this week in terms of brainstorming. Our idea kept getting close to attruition until we all decided to try something different. It was not until we decided to make our scope clear and focus on something we all were intereste in that we came up with this idea.

### Successes
Luckily everyone played into their roles quite well. All of our roles were discussed and it seemed we were all in agreement and have a great share of responsibility between the 5 of us.

### Brief Overview
This week we decided to reinforce previous discussions and also begin dictating tasks and developing our product for the Beta. We decided for the beta that our focus is going to be on enhacninhg the initial spawn and intro set and intearctions, while also beginning development on the secondary stage intearctions and "1st level". The environemnt we chose to focus on for the beta is the "Raft in Autumn" painting. This is specifcally what I have been tasked with and will begin development on. The focus is to finalize the teleportation intearctioon, with a new voting system (similiar to Microsfots Sea of Thieves), and also begin production on the raft building intearction for the story progression. A teammate also introduced us to a repo that involves adding weather particle systems into A-Frame, so I will also test it out and see if it can be implemented. This was also the time that I spent creating the protoype for the alpha in which I was able to creaete a rudimentary version of the teleportation system.

### Challenge
While it was not a challenge per se, Jason and I had to clarify and decide how we wanted to split up the programming section of the project as we both displayed interst in that being our main priority. Another challenege that I have to get resolved is using the Nav Mesh sytem.

### Successes
Our disucsiion went well and eeveryone was able to bring something to the table to share, wheter that be assets they created, found or even integrating different repositories for weather systems.

### Brief Overview
This weeks main focus was preparing for our beta. My main focus was beginning to build the interactions on the second environemtn. Unfortuantely this week was not as productive as I hoped. I had a huge amount of deadlines that I had to sink time to so I was not able to complete the amount I desired to. Although I did manage to implement the artifact placement feature that was in my previous assingment into this. My main goal is seeing how I can streamline that process with some of the features avaiable in in CirclesXR

### Challenge
Time Time and Time. Again the issue was not being able to put it in as much time as I would ahve hoped for.

### Successes
The implemeentation went somewhat well. I just hope to be able to incoorpearte more features from CirclesXR into the interaction, such as the holding mechanic

### Brief Overview
This week again was prepping for the beta. I managed to build upon the game manager entity which will be hosting the quests for the user. Currently there has been a new manager script for the Raft in Autumn. This is what I worked on during this time. I managed to alloow the users to begin the quest when the teleport and change environment occurs. It spawns four logs which the user can interact with. The logs spawn for all connected users. I managed to also figure out how to streamline this intearction quite well by restrcuturing how I planned to create the code. I am now going to take advantage of circles alrready implemented pickup object feature rather than create a new pickup feature. The reason i was going to do this initially is because I beleived I had to create something new in order to introduce the feature of also placing the item on the raft. Although my new idea is to make it so that this occurs simply based on collision. Once the user brings the log to a certain point and collides with the zone. The log is deleted and it appears on the model. This will mimic the feature of placing the log down but require a lot less difficulties. 

### Challenge
My main challenge was implementing the new features on game manager, although these were just normal regular bugs tha were able to be fixed.

### Successes
The new strcuture of how the intearction will work has shifted the amount of time and effort needed to create the intearction.

### Brief Overview
The prior streamlining that I thought I figured out presetnedd some unusual bugs that I managed to overcome. Although now I was able to compelte this feature. Completing the quest for the first room. I just need to fix a small issue where the logs are not moving perfectly through websockets. This should not be too much of an issue. This week was the most intensive and unfortunately a lot of problems arised. I wanted to mainly work on completing this feature altough due to unforseen circumstances I had to work on thigns outside of my assigned scope. This was due to mismanagement and a lack of completion on other specified parts, specifcally set dressing the first room. While this is an issue that arises in group settings luckily with some overworked nights I and another team member were able to bring the studio to a subpar level of satsifation. This did however remove time from working on completing the quest completion process.

### Challenge
Some bugs resulted in the online feature not working as intended although a fix is currently in developmet. I also had to focus on things outside my assigned scope due to mismanagement.

### Successes
I playable quest is now avaialbe and the first quest interaction is complete.
